Objective :- 

The objective of this project is to develop a Power BI dashboard for anomaly detection in credit card transactions. Anomaly detection is crucial for detecting fraudulent activities and ensuring the security of credit card transactions. By leveraging Power BI's data visualization and analytical capabilities, we can create an interactive dashboard that provides insights into transaction patterns and identifies potential anomalies.

INSIGHT :-

The maximum amount of a single transaction found to be fraudulent is over 0.6 million.

When the payment type is Cash Out, the number of fraudulent and normal transactions increases significantly to 0.22 million.

The average fraudulent transaction amount is 881.59 thousand, which is higher than the average transaction amount of 161.94 thousand, indicating a significant impact of fraudulent transactions. The number of transactions gradually increases as the hours progress, reaching a peak of 51352 transactions at 19 hours.

After that, the count of transactions fluctuates but eventually stabilizes at 30904 transactions at 34 hours.
